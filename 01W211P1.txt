Level 7:
	You dodge the attack by swerving, and the hound tumbles down the stairs, 
but not before slashing your arm. You hear it yelp as it falls, and then thereâ€™s 
a deathly silence. The hound is not coming back. You drop the spear and run up 
to the top room. You find your brother locked up inside, crying. You take him 
downstairs slowly, and pick up the spear just in case the hound returns. But the 
beast is nowhere to be seen. As you both make your way back, he thanks you for 
saving his life. Ah, finally something good out of this.
