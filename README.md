# ENGG1340-Project: Group 115

## Game Description:
The game we present here is an example of a strategic text-based adventure game, wherein the storyline focuses on the player finding/rescuing his brother from an old dilapidated castle. From solving coded cyphers to taking major gambles, the choices the user makes ultimately decide his fate, and that of his brother.

## The Plot:
It all started when your younger brother Sean and you decided to spend the summer break with your aunt in her quaint village. You had heard stories about the old run-down castle situated at the far end of the village, particularly the legend of the monster that had been imprisoned there. That evening, as you stared the castle from the window of your room, those thoughts re-emerged: Was it all true? Could there really be something there? Seeing your tense and nervous face, your brother cracked up and challenged you to a game of hide-and-seek at the castle. Embarrassed and determined to not come across as a wimp, you accepted it.

He’s already gone off to the castle, and now as you walk up to it, you look up at the menacing towers and realise there’s no backing out of this one. Ah shit, here we go again…
