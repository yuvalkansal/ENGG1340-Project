## Game Description:
The game we present here is an example of a strategic text-based adventure game, wherein the storyline focuses on the player finding/rescuing his brother from an old dilapidated castle. From solving coded cyphers to taking major gambles, the choices the user makes ultimately decide his fate, and that of his brother.

## The Plot:
It all started when your younger brother Sean and you decided to spend the summer break with your aunt in her quaint village. You had heard stories about the old run-down castle situated at the far end of the village, particularly the legend of the monster that had been imprisoned there. That evening, as you stared the castle from the window of your room, those thoughts re-emerged: Was it all true? Could there really be something there? Seeing your tense and nervous face, your brother cracked up and challenged you to a game of hide-and-seek at the castle. Embarrassed and determined to not come across as a wimp, you accepted it.

He’s already gone off to the castle, and now as you walk up to it, you look up at the menacing towers and realise there’s no backing out of this one. You have to find your brother and get out of here as soon as possible provided there's no danger awaiting you. Haha joke, UNLESS?? Ah shit, here we go again…

## Instructions:
-The game starts off with you entering the courtyard, which is interspersed with skulls and other scary items. You come across 2 types of weapons - ***a sword and a spear***. But here's the catch. You can only carry one of those with you. The choice is not going to be easy and the choice will go a long way in deciding your fate in the game.
- After picking up a weapon, you get to choose either of the ways to choose. You can either go to the towers or the scary dungeons.
- The journey is not over yet. After choosing a way, you face many obstacles and there are important decisions to be made.
- Choose wisely and remember your ultimate goal **find your brother and get out the place as soon as possible.**
- Best of luck navigating and may the odds be ever in your favour!

## Game Features:
//Insert the features of the game here, from random generators to loadfiles.
1. Our game consists of many alternate endings which depend on the decisions you make throughout the game.
2. There are many riddles for the user to solve along the way which are essentially ciphers (e.g. Caesar's cipher)
3. The user's data such as his username and password are stored using dynamic memory manipulation in files.
4. Probability of overcoming hardest obstacles is jointly dependent on the weapon the user chooses and using the random function to generate probability (e.g if you have the right weapon, your winning probability might be 75% -90% whereas if you choose the wrong weapon it would only be 50%)
5. Dynamic memory will be used to store and evaluate the user's responses. If the user's responses are correct, he will proceed to make the correct decisions which will give him a leverage in the game.

## Data Structure
// describe the data structure to be used and what members will it consist of


## Advanced Features:
//such as OOP and all.


Create a readme.md file there in the repo, which should contain:
1. A brief identification of the team members.
2. A game description with basic game rules.
3. A list of features / functions that you plan to implement, vis-a-vis each of the items 1 to 5 listed under coding requirements above.
4. Hand in a link to the repo to Moodle.

Encompass these features

- Generation of random game sets or events
- Data structures for storing game status
- Dynamic memory management
- File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving game status)
- Program codes in multiple files
- Proper indentation and naming styles
- In-code documentation
