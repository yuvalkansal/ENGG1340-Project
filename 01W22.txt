Level 4:
	You believe your brother might be in the dungeons. After hearing that 
scream, you realise he could actually be trapped behind a door or something. You 
rush down into the dark dingy depths of the dungeon.You find this old flame 
torch and light it up with your lighter. Coupled with the faint light from a 
torch and the smell of bats, this place could definitely do with a retouch. In 
front of you are two ways again. Thereâ€™s an inscription on the wall:
