Level 7:
	The hound strikes. You try blocking it off with the spear, but no use; 
the spear was made of old wood, and it broke into two. The hound slashes across 
your arm, and it rips it open. You scream in agony and try to defend yourself, 
and in the next attack you manage to stab the beast near its heart. However it 
gets you too, and your body has slash marks across it, and youâ€™re losing a lot 
of blood. Time seems to come to a standstill. You close your eyes, and go into 
a deep sleep.
